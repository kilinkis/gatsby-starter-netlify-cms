Howdy! I'm a web developer from beautiful Mar del Plata (below), Argentina. Although I may be [somewhere else](https://www.instagram.com/kilinkis/).

I have more than 10 years of experience in web development, where my expertise is WordPress (I have a PHP background) and front end technologies. 

Currently I lead the Front-end Development Team at prestigious [Mobomo, LLC.](https://clutch.co/developers/wordpress/research), a Washington D.C. company with clients like Mars, USO and NASA.

I pay extra attention to details and love to see my products have a nice bold finish. I consider myself passionate about web development and believe in working hard every day.
